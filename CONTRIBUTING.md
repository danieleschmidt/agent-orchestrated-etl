   ```bash
   make validate  # Runs all quality checks
   make test      # Runs all tests
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR on GitHub
   ```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Ensure code quality checks pass: `make validate`
- [ ] Add tests that prove your fix is effective or that your feature works
- [ ] Update documentation for any new or changed functionality
- [ ] Ensure your commit messages follow our conventions

### Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(agents): add new transformation agent for JSON data
fix(orchestrator): resolve memory leak in pipeline execution
docs(api): update API documentation with new endpoints
test(integration): add comprehensive pipeline tests
```

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass automated tests and quality checks
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer must review and approve the PR
3. **Testing**: Reviewers will test the changes in their environment
4. **Documentation**: Ensure all changes are properly documented
5. **Merge**: Maintainers will merge approved PRs

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- **PEP 8**: Follow Python's official style guide
- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black formatter)
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes

```python
def process_data_source(
    source_url: str, 
    options: Dict[str, Any] = None
) -> ProcessingResult:
    """Process data from the specified source.
    
    Args:
        source_url: URL or identifier for the data source.
        options: Optional processing configuration.
        
    Returns:
        ProcessingResult containing processed data and metadata.
        
    Raises:
        DataSourceError: If source cannot be accessed.
        ValidationError: If data validation fails.
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation Style

- **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown for documentation
- **Clear Headers**: Use descriptive headers and subheaders
- **Code Examples**: Include working code examples
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal documentation

### Testing Guidelines

- **Coverage**: Maintain at least 80% test coverage
- **Test Types**: Include unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- **Fixtures**: Use pytest fixtures for common test data

```python
def test_pipeline_creation_with_valid_source():
    """Test that pipeline is created successfully with valid data source."""
    orchestrator = DataOrchestrator()
    pipeline = orchestrator.create_pipeline(source="mock://test-data")
    
    assert pipeline is not None
    assert pipeline.source == "mock://test-data"
```
