# 🧭 Project Vision & Context

Agent-Orchestrated ETL provides a lightweight framework to auto-generate and execute ETL
pipelines. It targets data engineers who need quick prototyping without heavy
infrastructure. The system analyzes simple metadata to build DAGs and exposes a CLI for
running pipelines or exporting Airflow code.

- **Themes**: Logging, Documentation
- **Deliverables**
  - Introduce configurable log levels and JSON log output
  - Provide example pipelines and quickstart docs
  - Document developer setup and troubleshooting
- **Definition of Done**
  - Structured logs appear in sample runs and README updated with examples

## Increment 3 – Performance & Release ✦
- **Themes**: Optimization, Packaging
- **Deliverables**
  - Profile DAG generation and remove O(n^2) steps
  - Cache data source analysis results
  - Prepare CHANGELOG and publish first release

# ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation
- Requirements creep on AI features → freeze scope each increment
- CI flakiness or slow jobs → use dependency caching and pinned versions
- Limited test data for pipelines → build synthetic datasets for repeatability
- Secret leakage via misconfigured envs → enforce secret scan pre-commit
- Performance regressions → add benchmarks to CI pipeline

---

# 📊 KPIs & Metrics
- [ ] >85% test coverage
- [ ] <15 min CI pipeline time
- [ ] <5% error rate on core service
- [ ] 100% secrets loaded from vault/env
