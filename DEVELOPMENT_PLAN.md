# Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] **Feature:** Intelligent DAG generation based on data source analysis
- [ ] **Feature:** LangChain agents that route between extraction, transformation, and loading tasks
- [ ] **Feature:** Dynamic pipeline optimization using LLM reasoning
- [ ] **Feature:** Integration with popular data sources (S3, PostgreSQL, APIs)
- [ ] **Feature:** Real-time monitoring and error recovery through agent decision-making

## Phase 2: Upcoming Roadmap Features
- [ ] Add support for streaming data sources
- [ ] Implement cost optimization recommendations
- [ ] Build Slack/Teams integration for pipeline notifications

## Phase 3: Testing & Hardening
- [ ] **Testing:** Write unit tests for all feature modules.
- [ ] **Testing:** Add integration tests for the API and data pipelines.
- [ ] **Hardening:** Run security (`bandit`) and quality (`ruff`) scans and fix all reported issues.

## Phase 4: Documentation & Release
- [ ] **Docs:** Create a comprehensive `API_USAGE_GUIDE.md` with endpoint examples.
- [ ] **Docs:** Update `README.md` with final setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] **Release:** Prepare `CHANGELOG.md` and tag the v1.0.0 release.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Scaffolding:** Set up core project structure, dependencies, and CI/CD pipeline.
- [x] **Testing:** Establish a testing framework (`pytest`, `jest`, etc.) with initial tests.
- [x] **Configuration:** Centralize configuration management (e.g., using a config file or environment variables).
- [x] **Feature:** Implement the primary data extraction logic.
- [x] **Feature:** Implement the core transformation logic.
