# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Template

Due to GitHub App permissions, the CI/CD workflow file needs to be created manually. Here's the complete workflow configuration to add to your repository.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create the directory structure in your repository:
   ```
   .github/
   └── workflows/
       └── ci.yml
   ```

2. Copy the following content into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"

jobs:

## Features

This CI/CD pipeline provides:

### Security Features
- **Bandit Security Scanning**: Detects common security issues in Python code
- **Safety Vulnerability Check**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Ruff Linting**: Code quality and security linting
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent credential commits

### Quality Assurance
- **Type Checking**: MyPy static type analysis
- **Code Formatting**: Automated code formatting verification
- **Complexity Analysis**: Radon complexity checking
- **Documentation Style**: PEP 257 docstring conventions

### Testing
- **Multi-Python Support**: Tests across Python 3.8-3.12
- **Coverage Reporting**: Test coverage analysis and reporting
- **Artifact Upload**: Security reports and build artifacts

### Build Verification
- **Package Building**: Validates package can be built correctly
- **Distribution Check**: Validates package metadata and structure

## Customization

You can customize this workflow by:

1. **Adjusting Python versions** in the test matrix
2. **Adding integration tests** with database services
3. **Configuring deployment** stages for staging/production
4. **Adding performance benchmarks** for regression testing
5. **Integrating with external security scanners**

## Required Secrets

For full functionality, configure these repository secrets:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting (optional)
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For automated package publishing (if needed)

## Troubleshooting

- If security scans fail, review the uploaded reports in the Actions artifacts
- Coverage failures indicate insufficient test coverage (target: >85%)
- Build failures may indicate packaging issues or missing dependencies

This template provides a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that enforces security and quality standards for the Agent-Orchestrated ETL project.
