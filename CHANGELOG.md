## [0.0.1] - 2025-01-27

### Added
- Initial project structure
- Basic agent framework with LangChain integration
- ETL agent specializations (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Orchestrator agent for pipeline coordination
- Monitor agent for pipeline health tracking
- CLI interface for pipeline execution
- Support for multiple data sources (file, S3, database, API)

### Features
- **Intelligent Pipeline Generation**: Automatically analyzes data sources and creates optimal ETL pipelines
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Specialized agents for different aspects of data processing
- **Multiple Data Source Support**: 
  - Local files (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
  - AWS S3 buckets
  - SQL databases
  - REST APIs
  - Mock data for testing
- **Dynamic Pipeline Optimization**: Agents adapt pipeline structure based on data characteristics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Pipeline health tracking and performance metrics
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new agents and data source connectors

### Technical Specifications
- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - LangChain for agent framework
  - Pandas for data processing
  - SQLAlchemy for database connectivity
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - AsyncIO for concurrent processing
- **Supported Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Container Support**: Docker and Docker Compose

### Usage Examples
```python
from agent_orchestrated_etl import DataOrchestrator

# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = DataOrchestrator()

# Simple file processing
pipeline = orchestrator.create_pipeline(source="file://data.csv")
result = pipeline.execute()

# S3 data processing
pipeline = orchestrator.create_pipeline(source="s3://bucket/data/")
result = pipeline.execute()

# Custom transformations
pipeline = orchestrator.create_pipeline(
    source="file://data.csv",
    operations={"transform": lambda data: process_data(data)}
)
result = pipeline.execute()
```

### Known Limitations
- Limited to single-node processing (distributed processing planned for future releases)
- Basic error handling and retry mechanisms
- Minimal security features (enhanced security planned)
- No web UI (planned for future releases)

# From source
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agent-orchestrated-etl.git
cd agent-orchestrated-etl
pip install -e .

# With development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```
