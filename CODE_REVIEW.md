# Code Review

## Summary
- Implemented data source analysis and DAG generator modules
- Added CLI command `generate_dag` and supporting tests
- Updated sprint board and development plan
- Unit tests cover S3, PostgreSQL, invalid metadata, and CLI behavior

## Static Analysis
- `ruff` passed with no issues
- `bandit` reported no security findings
- `pytest` ran 14 tests successfully

## Strengths
- Clear separation between data source analysis and DAG generation
- Unit tests thoroughly verify current functionality, including CLI error handling
- Packaging configured via `pyproject.toml` with console script entry point

## Areas for Improvement
- `generate_dag` only validates metadata; actual metadata-driven DAG creation is minimal. Future work could incorporate the fields/tables information.
- CLI writes out a simple dictionary; consider generating a real Airflow DAG file in future iterations.
- Some tests include `# nosec` commentsâ€”ensure these are required and not hiding potential issues.
- `scripts/generate_tests.py` auto-generates tests but isn't used in the normal workflow; document its intent or integrate it.

Overall, the branch meets the current acceptance criteria and passes all checks. The foundational structure is in place, but the implementation remains simplistic and can be expanded to realize the full roadmap features.
