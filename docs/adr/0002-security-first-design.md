# ADR-0002: Security-First Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
ETL systems handle sensitive data and credentials, making security a critical concern. Recent implementations have added SQL injection prevention and AWS Secrets Manager integration, indicating a shift toward security-conscious architecture.

## Decision
We will implement a security-first design approach with the following principles:

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: All data sources and connections are untrusted by default
2. **Secret Management**: Centralized credential management using AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs and data sources undergo validation
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data access and transformations
5. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all system components

## Rationale
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements and regulations
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents data breaches and unauthorized access
- **Trust**: Builds confidence in the system for handling sensitive data
- **Auditability**: Provides complete trail for security audits

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced data protection and compliance posture
- Reduced risk of security incidents
- Improved customer trust and adoption
- Clear audit trails for regulatory compliance

### Negative
- Additional development overhead for security implementations
- Potential performance impact from security checks
- Increased complexity in deployment and configuration
- Regular security updates and maintenance required

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate AWS Secrets Manager for all credential storage
- Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add input validation at all system boundaries
- Enable comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments
