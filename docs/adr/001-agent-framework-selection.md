# ADR-001: Agent Framework Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires an intelligent agent framework capable of:
- Dynamic decision making for ETL pipeline optimization
- Integration with various data sources and systems
- Extensible architecture for custom agents
- Strong Python ecosystem integration

Key options considered:
1. **LangChain**: Comprehensive framework with extensive tool ecosystem
2. **CrewAI**: Multi-agent collaboration framework
3. **AutoGen**: Microsoft's multi-agent conversation framework
4. **Custom Framework**: Build from scratch using OpenAI API

## Decision
We have chosen **LangChain** as our agent framework.

### Rationale
- **Ecosystem**: Extensive library of pre-built tools and integrations
- **Flexibility**: Modular architecture allows custom agent implementation
- **Community**: Large, active community with frequent updates
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **ETL Integration**: Natural fit for data pipeline orchestration
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Rich set of tools for database, API, and file system interactions

## Consequences

### Positive
- Rapid development due to pre-built components
- Strong integration capabilities with data sources
- Established patterns for agent orchestration
- Good performance for ETL workloads
- Active maintenance and security updates

### Negative
- Dependency on external framework evolution
- Potential vendor lock-in to LangChain ecosystem
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with LangChain
- Framework overhead for simple operations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement abstraction layers to reduce tight coupling
- Maintain fallback implementations for critical components
- Regular framework version updates and compatibility testing
- Team training on LangChain best practices
