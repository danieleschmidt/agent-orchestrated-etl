# ADR-002: Workflow Engine Choice

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Agent-Orchestrated-ETL system requires a robust workflow orchestration engine to manage complex data pipelines. The engine must support dynamic DAG generation, handle dependencies, provide monitoring capabilities, and integrate well with our agent-based architecture.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Apache Airflow
- **Pros**: Mature ecosystem, extensive integrations, Python-native, strong community
- **Cons**: Complex setup, resource-intensive, traditional DAG approach
- **Integration**: Natural fit with agent-generated DAGs

### Option 2: Prefect
- **Pros**: Modern API, cloud-native, simpler deployment, better error handling
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, newer project, fewer integrations
- **Integration**: Good API for agent interactions

### Option 3: Temporal
- **Pros**: Excellent durability guarantees, workflow as code, strong consistency
- **Cons**: Steep learning curve, different programming model, complex deployment
- **Integration**: Requires significant agent architecture changes

### Option 4: Custom Workflow Engine
- **Pros**: Perfect fit for agent requirements, full control
- **Cons**: High development cost, maintenance burden, limited community
- **Integration**: Built specifically for agents

## Decision
We choose **Apache Airflow** as our primary workflow orchestration engine.

## Rationale
1. **Ecosystem Maturity**: Airflow has the largest ecosystem of connectors and integrations
2. **Agent Compatibility**: DAG generation aligns well with agent decision-making
3. **Operational Expertise**: Most data engineering teams have Airflow experience
4. **Community Support**: Large community provides extensive documentation and support
5. **Enterprise Adoption**: Proven at scale in production environments

## Implementation Plan
1. Integrate agent-generated DAGs with Airflow's DAG parsing
2. Use Airflow's REST API for runtime pipeline management
3. Implement custom operators for agent-specific tasks
4. Leverage Airflow's monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Leverage existing Airflow expertise and tooling
- Access to comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools
- Extensive third-party integrations available
- Battle-tested in production environments

### Negative
- Higher resource requirements compared to lightweight alternatives
- Complex configuration and deployment
- Need to work within Airflow's DAG execution model
- Potential performance bottlenecks with high DAG volume

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Airflow complexity overwhelming agent benefits
  - **Mitigation**: Abstract Airflow complexity behind agent interfaces
- **Risk**: Performance issues with dynamic DAG generation
  - **Mitigation**: Implement DAG caching and optimization strategies
- **Risk**: Version compatibility issues with LangChain integration
  - **Mitigation**: Pin dependencies and maintain compatibility matrix
