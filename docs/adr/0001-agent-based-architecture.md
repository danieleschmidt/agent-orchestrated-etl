# ADR-0001: Agent-Based ETL Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional ETL systems are rigid and require manual intervention for pipeline optimization and error handling. As data sources become more diverse and data volumes increase, there's a need for intelligent, self-optimizing ETL systems that can adapt to changing requirements and handle failures gracefully.

## Decision
We will implement an agent-based ETL architecture using LangChain agents integrated with Apache Airflow for pipeline execution. The system will consist of specialized agents:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Makes high-level decisions about pipeline structure
2. **ETL Agents**: Handle specific extraction, transformation, and loading tasks
3. **Monitor Agent**: Provides real-time monitoring and optimization suggestions

## Rationale
- **Adaptability**: Agents can learn from data patterns and optimize pipelines automatically
- **Fault Tolerance**: Intelligent error handling and recovery strategies
- **Scalability**: Distributed agent architecture allows for horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns through specialized agents
- **Integration**: Leverages existing Airflow infrastructure while adding intelligence

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced manual intervention in pipeline management
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Dynamic optimization based on data characteristics
- Better observability through agent decision logging

### Negative
- Increased complexity in system architecture
- Additional overhead from agent decision-making processes
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with agent architectures
- Potential for unexpected agent behaviors requiring monitoring

## Implementation Notes
- Use LangChain for agent framework
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Airflow DAGs
- Implement comprehensive logging for agent decisions
- Create fallback mechanisms for agent failures
