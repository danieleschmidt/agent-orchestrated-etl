# ADR-004: Monitoring and Observability Approach

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Agent-Orchestrated-ETL system requires comprehensive monitoring and observability to:
- Track agent decision-making effectiveness
- Monitor pipeline performance and reliability
- Detect anomalies and failures early
- Provide insights for system optimization
- Support debugging and troubleshooting
- Enable SLA monitoring and alerting

The system must observe both traditional infrastructure metrics and AI agent-specific behaviors.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack
- **Pros**: Open source, mature ecosystem, flexible
- **Cons**: Complex setup, high maintenance overhead
- **Agent Observability**: Requires custom instrumentation

### Option 2: DataDog
- **Pros**: SaaS solution, excellent UX, comprehensive features
- **Cons**: High cost, vendor lock-in, limited customization
- **Agent Observability**: Good APM for agent tracing

### Option 3: New Relic
- **Pros**: Application-focused, good Python support, AI insights
- **Cons**: Expensive, complex pricing model
- **Agent Observability**: Strong APM capabilities

### Option 4: OpenTelemetry + Jaeger + Prometheus
- **Pros**: Vendor-neutral, comprehensive tracing, growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: Relatively new, complex configuration
- **Agent Observability**: Excellent for distributed agent tracing

### Option 5: Hybrid Approach (OpenTelemetry + Multiple Backends)
- **Pros**: Flexibility, vendor independence, best-of-breed
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, multiple systems to manage
- **Agent Observability**: Comprehensive coverage

## Decision
We choose a **Hybrid OpenTelemetry-based approach** with multiple specialized backends:

1. **OpenTelemetry** for instrumentation and data collection
2. **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting
3. **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
4. **Grafana** for visualization and dashboards
5. **ELK Stack** for log aggregation and analysis
6. **Custom Agent Analytics Platform** for AI-specific metrics

## Implementation Details

### OpenTelemetry Instrumentation
```python
from opentelemetry import trace, metrics
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.exporter.prometheus import PrometheusMetricReader
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider

# Trace configuration
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Metrics configuration
metric_reader = PrometheusMetricReader()
metrics.set_meter_provider(MeterProvider(metric_readers=[metric_reader]))
meter = metrics.get_meter(__name__)

# Custom metrics
pipeline_duration = meter.create_histogram(
    "pipeline_execution_duration_seconds",
    description="Time taken to execute pipelines",
    unit="s"
)

agent_decisions = meter.create_counter(
    "agent_decisions_total",
    description="Total number of agent decisions made",
)

# Usage in agent code
@tracer.start_as_current_span("orchestrator_decision")
def make_orchestration_decision(self, pipeline_request):
    span = trace.get_current_span()
    span.set_attribute("pipeline.source_type", pipeline_request.source_type)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        decision = self._analyze_and_decide(pipeline_request)
        span.set_attribute("decision.pipeline_type", decision.pipeline_type)
        agent_decisions.add(1, {"decision_type": decision.pipeline_type})
        return decision
    finally:
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        pipeline_duration.record(duration, {"source_type": pipeline_request.source_type})
```

### Agent Analytics Platform Schema

      - alert: PipelineFailureRateHigh
        expr: rate(pipeline_executions_failed_total[5m]) / rate(pipeline_executions_total[5m]) > 0.1
        for: 2m
        labels:
