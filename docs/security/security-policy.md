# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the Agent-Orchestrated-ETL project.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults
- Principle of least privilege
- Zero-trust architecture

### 2. Security by Design
- Security considerations from project inception
- Threat modeling for all components
- Regular security reviews
- Automated security testing

## Threat Model

### Assets
- **Primary Assets**
  - Source data (potentially sensitive)
  - Pipeline configurations
  - Processing results
  - Authentication credentials
  - System infrastructure

- **Supporting Assets**
  - Application code
  - Configuration files
  - Logs and metrics
  - Documentation

### Threats
- **Data Breaches**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Code Injection**: SQL injection, command injection, code injection
- **Authentication Bypass**: Weak or broken authentication
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of access rights
- **Denial of Service**: Service disruption attacks
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or containers

### Mitigations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries
- Strong authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Dependency scanning and SBOM generation

## Security Controls

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

#### Authentication Requirements
- All API endpoints require authentication
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access
- API key rotation every 90 days

#### Authorization Framework
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Resource-level permissions
- Audit trail for all access decisions

#### Roles and Permissions

```yaml
roles:
  admin:
    permissions:
      - pipeline:*
      - system:*
      - users:*
  
  operator:
    permissions:
      - pipeline:create
      - pipeline:execute
      - pipeline:view
      - metrics:view
  
  viewer:
    permissions:
      - pipeline:view
      - metrics:view
```

### 2. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Documentation, public APIs
- **Internal**: System metrics, logs (non-sensitive)
- **Confidential**: Pipeline configurations, processing results
- **Restricted**: Authentication credentials, encryption keys

#### Data Handling
- Automatic PII detection and masking
- Data retention policies (7 years for compliance)
- Secure data disposal procedures
- Regular data inventory audits

### 3. Network Security

#### Network Architecture
- Private subnets for application components
- Public subnets only for load balancers
- Network segmentation between environments
- VPC flow logs for network monitoring

#### Firewall Rules
- Default deny all
- Explicit allow rules for required traffic
- Regular review and cleanup of rules
- Geo-blocking for high-risk countries

#### API Security
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per client)
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- API versioning and deprecation policies

### 4. Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
- Minimal base images (distroless when possible)
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Resource limits and quotas

#### Orchestration Security
- Pod security policies
- Network policies
- RBAC for Kubernetes resources
- Secrets management (not in environment variables)

#### Cloud Security
- IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Resource tagging for governance
- CloudTrail logging enabled
- GuardDuty for threat detection

### 5. Application Security

#### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Output encoding for all dynamic content
- Parameterized queries for database access
- Secure random number generation
- Error handling without information disclosure

#### Dependency Management
- Automated dependency scanning
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Known vulnerability tracking
- Regular dependency updates

#### Code Security
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
- Peer code review requirements

## Security Monitoring

### 1. Logging and Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Authorization decisions
- Administrative actions
- Data access patterns
- Configuration changes

#### Log Management
- Centralized logging (ELK stack or CloudWatch)
- Log integrity protection
- Long-term retention (7 years)
- Real-time analysis and alerting

#### Monitoring Metrics
- Failed authentication rate
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- System resource utilization
- Network traffic anomalies

### 2. Incident Response

#### Incident Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, system compromise
- **High**: Service disruption, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: Failed attacks, policy violations
- **Low**: Suspicious activity, minor policy violations

#### Response Timeline
- **Detection**: < 15 minutes (automated)
- **Assessment**: < 1 hour
- **Containment**: < 4 hours
- **Resolution**: < 24 hours (varies by severity)

#### Response Team
- Security Officer (lead)
- System Administrator
- Legal Counsel (for critical incidents)
- Public Relations (for public-facing incidents)

### 3. Vulnerability Management

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- Weekly automated scans
- Manual penetration testing (quarterly)
- Bug bounty program (if public-facing)
- Third-party security assessments (annually)

#### Patch Management
- Critical patches: 24 hours
- High severity: 7 days
- Medium severity: 30 days
- Low severity: Next maintenance window
