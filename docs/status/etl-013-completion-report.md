## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Agent Capability Framework

**Extended AgentCapability Class:**
```python
class AgentCapability(BaseModel):
    # Original fields
    name: str
    description: str
    input_types: List[str]
    output_types: List[str]
    confidence_level: float
    
    # Enhanced metadata (NEW)
    specialization_areas: List[str]
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, Any]
    resource_requirements: Dict[str, Any]
    version: str
    last_updated: float
    tags: List[str]
    prerequisites: List[str]
```

**Key Enhancements:**
- **Specialization Areas:** Fine-grained capability categorization (e.g., ["postgresql", "mysql"] for database capabilities)
- **Performance Metrics:** Historical performance data (throughput, success rate, execution time)
- **Resource Requirements:** Memory, CPU, and infrastructure requirements
- **Versioning:** Capability evolution tracking with semantic versioning
- **Tags & Prerequisites:** Enhanced searchability and dependency management

### Intelligent Capability Matching

**Context-Aware Inference Algorithm:**
```python
def _get_enhanced_capabilities(self, task: CoordinationTask) -> List[str]:
```

**Intelligence Features:**
- **Volume-Based Inference:** Large data â†’ high_throughput + memory_optimization
- **Complexity-Based Inference:** High complexity â†’ advanced_algorithms + error_handling
- **Real-Time Requirements:** real_time flag â†’ real_time_processing + low_latency
- **Data Source Specialization:** "postgresql" â†’ postgresql_optimization + database_optimization
- **Format Specialization:** "json" â†’ json_processing + schema_validation

**Example Capability Inference:**
```
Task: {data_source: "postgresql", volume: "large", real_time: true}
Inferred: ["data_extraction", "postgresql_optimization", "database_optimization", 
           "high_throughput", "memory_optimization", "real_time_processing", "low_latency"]
```

### Performance-Based Agent Selection

**Multi-Metric Scoring Algorithm:**
```python
def _calculate_performance_score(self, agent, task) -> float:
```

**Performance Metrics Integration:**
- **Success Rate:** Historical task completion success percentage
- **Execution Time:** Average task execution time with penalty for slow agents
- **Availability:** Agent uptime and reliability metrics
- **Throughput:** Records/tasks processed per unit time
- **Error Rate:** Failure rate with weighted penalty

**Adaptive Weighting:**
- **High-Performance Tasks:** Prioritize speed and reliability (success_rate: 40%, execution_time: 30%)
- **Standard Tasks:** Balanced approach (success_rate: 50%, availability: 30%, error_rate: 20%)

### Advanced Agent Evaluation

**BaseAgent Performance Tracking:**
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = {
            "total_tasks": 0,
            "successful_tasks": 0,
            "avg_execution_time": 0.0,
            "success_rate": 1.0,
            "throughput": 0.0,
            "availability": 1.0
        }
    
    def update_performance_metrics(self, task, execution_time, success):
        # Real-time performance tracking
    
    def get_specialization_score(self, task_type) -> float:
        # Historical performance for specific task types
```

**Comprehensive Agent Scoring:**
```python
combined_score = (
    capability_score * 0.4 +      # Capability match quality
    performance_score * 0.3 +     # Historical performance
    specialization_score * 0.2 +  # Task type specialization
    (1.0 - load_factor) * 0.1     # Load balancing preference
)
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

**Intelligent Fallback Strategies:**

#### 1. Partial Match Strategy
- **Trigger:** 30-70% capability match
- **Action:** Select best partial match with mitigation
- **Output:** Gap analysis and monitoring recommendations

#### 2. Task Decomposition Strategy
- **Trigger:** <30% capability match
- **Action:** Recommend task breakdown
- **Output:** Component task suggestions and orchestration plan

**Fallback Response Structure:**
```python
{
    "strategy": "partial_match",
    "recommended_agent": "agent_id",
    "match_score": 0.45,
    "capability_gap": ["missing_capability_1", "missing_capability_2"],
    "mitigation_steps": [
        "Monitor execution closely for potential issues",
        "Consider capability enhancement or training"
    ]
}
```

### Load Balancing System

**Real-Time Load Tracking:**
```python
def get_current_load(self) -> float:
    active_task_count = len(self.active_tasks)
    max_concurrent = self.config.extra_config.get('max_concurrent_tasks', 5)
    return min(active_task_count / max_concurrent, 1.0)
```

**Load-Adjusted Selection:**
```python
load_adjusted_score = capability_score * (1.0 - current_load)
```

**Load Distribution Metrics:**
- **Agent Loads:** Real-time load factors for all agents
- **Load Distribution History:** Historical load patterns
- **Balancing Effectiveness:** Variance-based load distribution quality metric

### Comprehensive Audit Trail

**Selection Decision Logging:**
```python
audit_entry = {
    "task_id": task.task_id,
    "selected_agent": selected_agent,
    "selection_score": combined_score,
    "alternatives_considered": len(candidates),
    "selection_criteria": {
        "required_capabilities": capabilities,
        "performance_requirements": requirements,
        "load_balancing": True
    },
    "candidates": top_5_candidates,
    "timestamp": time.time(),
    "selection_time_ms": selection_duration
}
```
