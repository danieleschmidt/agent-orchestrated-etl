# Project Charter: Agent-Orchestrated-ETL

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Agent-Orchestrated-ETL  
**Project Type:** Intelligent Data Pipeline Orchestration Platform  
**Start Date:** 2024  
**Current Phase:** Production Readiness Enhancement  

## Problem Statement

Traditional ETL pipelines require significant manual configuration, lack adaptive optimization, and struggle with dynamic data source requirements. Organizations need intelligent, self-optimizing data pipelines that can adapt to changing data patterns and automatically recover from failures.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Hybrid Airflow + LangChain intelligent pipeline orchestration
- Dynamic DAG generation based on data source analysis
- Agent-based pipeline optimization and error recovery
- Multi-source data integration (S3, PostgreSQL, APIs, files)
- Real-time monitoring and adaptive pipeline management
- Production-ready deployment and scaling capabilities

### Out of Scope
- Custom data warehouse implementation (uses existing storage)
- Real-time streaming data processing (batch-focused)
- Business intelligence dashboard creation
- Data governance policy enforcement

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Pipeline Reliability:** 99.5% successful pipeline execution rate
2. **Automation Level:** 80% reduction in manual pipeline configuration
3. **Performance:** Sub-5-minute pipeline setup for new data sources
4. **Recovery Time:** Automatic failure recovery within 2 minutes
5. **Resource Efficiency:** 30% improvement in compute resource utilization

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. Developer productivity: 50% faster pipeline development
2. Code quality: >90% test coverage, zero critical security vulnerabilities
3. Documentation completeness: 100% API documentation coverage
4. Community adoption: 100+ GitHub stars, 10+ contributors

## Stakeholders

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Agent Decision Quality:** Risk of suboptimal pipeline choices
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, human oversight, fallback mechanisms
2. **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Agent coordination overhead at scale
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, distributed agent architecture
3. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Dynamic code generation risks
   - Mitigation: Input validation, sandboxing, security scanning

### Medium-Risk Items
1. External API dependencies and rate limiting
2. Data source schema evolution handling
3. Resource consumption unpredictability

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Zero critical or high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Code review approval required for all changes
- Automated linting and formatting enforcement

### Documentation Quality
- Complete API documentation with examples
- Architecture decision records for major decisions
- User guides for all supported features
- Developer onboarding documentation

### Operational Quality
- 99.5% uptime SLA for production deployments
- <5-second response time for pipeline status queries
- Automated backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Communication Plan

### Regular Updates
- **Daily:** Development team standups
- **Weekly:** Stakeholder progress updates
- **Monthly:** Steering committee reviews
- **Quarterly:** Strategic roadmap assessments

### Escalation Path
1. Development Team → Team Lead
2. Team Lead → Product Owner
3. Product Owner → Steering Committee
4. Critical Issues → Direct executive escalation
